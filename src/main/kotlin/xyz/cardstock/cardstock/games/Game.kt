/**
 * This class represents any game that [Cardstock] can facilitate.
 *
 * Games in Cardstock run on a state system. The game starts on the first state, which is provided in the constructor.
 * From there, if any call to [advanceState] is made, the next state, provided by [State.next][xyz.cardstock.cardstock.interfaces.states.State.next],
 * is made the current state. After setting the state, the listeners registered in [Stateful.stateListeners] are
 * invoked, allowing for the game to set up anything necessary for the current state.
 *
 * Games may also have a state in which multiple [Round][xyz.cardstock.cardstock.games.rounds.Round]s are carried out,
 * in a similar state-based process.
 *
 * Upon reaching the terminal state, the game is considered over and should be handled as appropriate.
 * @param[PlayerType] The type of [Player] that this game entertains
 * @constructor Creates a new Game.
 * @param[cardstock] The [Cardstock] facilitating this game.
 * @param[channel] The [Channel] that this game is taking place in.
